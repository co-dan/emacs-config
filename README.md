My simple emacs configuration.

Requires:

- MELPA
- [Better defaults](https://github.com/technomancy/better-defaults)
- [Alect themes](https://github.com/alezost/alect-themes)
- Packages for specific tasks: like RefTeX, AuCTeX, markdown-mode, magit,
  haskell-mode, ProofGeneral
  
Here is how it looks (I haven't tweaked the colors yet)

*Usually I don't open Magit, markdown and org files at the same time,
 that's just for showing off*
